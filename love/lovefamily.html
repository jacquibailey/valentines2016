<h1> Dear Mom, Dad, and Sister,</h1>
<p> You are the best humans I could ever be stuck with in this life. I love you very much! Thanks for always feeding me and loving me and stuff. </p>

<p>Dad, I hope you got Mom pretty flowers.</p>
<p>Mom, I hope you let Dad listen to the Rolling Stones as loud as he wants to today.</p>
<p> Kacie, I hope you aren't on-call this weekend.</p>
