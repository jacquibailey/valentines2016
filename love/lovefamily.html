<h1> Dear Mom, Dad, Sister, and Pup,</h1>
<p> You are the best humans I could ever be stuck with in this life. I love you very much! Thanks for always feeding me and loving me and stuff. </p>

<p>Dad, I hope you got Mom pretty flowers.</p>
<p>Mom, I hope you let Dad listen to the Rolling Stones as loud as he wants  today.</p>
<p> Sista, I hope you aren't on-call this weekend.</p>
<p> B-Dog, I hope you stay cute.</p>

<p>(You can change these to fit the family members in your life)

<p><b><i>Happy Valentine's Day!</i></b></p>
